# SearchTube

SearchTube is a web app that uses YouTube's API to let users watch videos from a search bar only. The goal is to make YouTube a more intentional viewing experience by forgoing the algorithm completely.
The app will also allow users to set daily viewing limits and blacklist certain types of videos (ie. react content).

This will also eventually become a PWA to serve as an alternative to the default YouTube app on mobile devices.

## Why build this?

I have wasted more time watching junk content on YouTube than I'm willing to admit. I believe that when used responsibly YouTube can be a powerful tool to learn and reinforce skills, studies, and work, but can also become the ultimate pitfall of hours wasted on junk content that you'll forget about in 24 hours.
